This pipeline was created to practice creating a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Ansible. It assumes that the jenkins server has Ansible installed.

The Jenkinsfile will create a pipeline that places the contents of the repository in /etc/ansible.

To work, it must have a ubuntu container running with openssh. The Dockerfile in containers will create this image. Open containers/Dockerfile and add your jenkins SSH key where $YOUR_KEY is. 

Once key is added, build the image and create the container run:
        docker build -t env .
        docker run -dit --name env0 env
        docker exec -it env0 service ssh start

This will build the image, create the container, and start the openssh server.

If there are any problems it may be because of the IP address. Check your containers IP address with 
        docker inspect env0 | grep IPAddress

And, make sure this is the IPAdress listed in hosts (I default it to 172.17.0.2).                         

Now, the pipeline is ready to be deployed. Commit changes and trigger an automatic build.
