This pipeline was created to practice creating a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Ansible. It assumes that a jenkins server has Ansible and Docker installed and is running a ubuntu container.

The pipeline will take the playbook in the repository and will execute the tasks in the container. The container is meant to simulate a server and save time (and money) of setting up cloud linux instances or Virtual Machines to test your playbook.
However, this pipeline will work with cloud instances. Just modify the IP address in hosts. 

The Jenkinsfile creates a pipeline that places the contents of the repository in /etc/ansible. 
To create the ubuntu container, open the Dockerfile and add your jenkins SSH key where $YOUR_KEY is. 

Once key is added, build the image and create the container run:
        docker build -t env .
        docker run -dit --name env0 env
        docker exec -it env0 service ssh start

This will build the image, create the container, and start the openssh server.

If there are any problems it may be because of the IP address. Check your containers IP address with 
        docker inspect env0 | grep IPAddress

And, make sure this is the same IPAdress listed in hosts (I default it to 172.17.0.2 b/c that is the default for a Docker container).

Now, the pipeline is ready to be deployed. Commit changes and trigger an automatic build.
